# Treasure Maze

A simple React-based maze game. Reach the treasure in the bottom-right corner within five minutes. Each playthrough randomizes the maze for replayability.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (Node.js and npm required):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play.

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The `build/` directory can be deployed to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Gameplay

Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze. Avoid walls and reach the treasure in the bottom-right corner before time runs out. Click **Play Again** to generate a new maze.
